				<h4>Example One</h4>
				<p>A CSS/JS solution for tables that allows them to shrink on small devices without sacrificing the value of tables, comparison of columns.</p>

				<p>Our solution for responsive tables requires two included files (both linked on this page): <code>responsive-tables.css</code> and <code>responsive-tables.js</code>. By attaching a class of <code>.js_tableResponsive</code> to the table, our JS/CSS will kick in.</p>

				<p>The JS will help us create some new elements on small devices, so we don't have to modify our table markup on the page. The CSS applies the requisite positioning and overflow styles to make the new elements work.</p>
