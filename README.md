# **phi**: A Web-App Toolkit and Modular Framework
## Do not use this. It is still in rapid development and in a pre-release stage.
## Status: Version 0.14-alpha â€” Currently: missing core app features; in cross-browser and cross-device testing.

The goal of this project is to create a web application toolkit and framework that's built with the best in modern technology, test-driven and incorporates the modular approach to application design. This is also a very opinionated stack that focuses on an intimate alignment and integration with the needed components to build a successful web-app, rather than a mash-up disparate technologies.
